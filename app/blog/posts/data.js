The word blog has always made me cringe, but here I am.

I watch so many people put their thoughts and ideas out into the world, but I rarely join them. There are many reasons for this—laziness, fear (of being cringy and wrong), lack of knowledge, perfectionism.

I’ve always wanted to get my ideas out there, to share them, and I do with those close to me. But I’m always worried about what others will think. I’m not sure my ideas are right, but I know they have merit—so here I am, putting them out into the world.

There’s a good chance these blogs will sound unoriginal and basic, like a great value knock-off. And I’m sure someone, somewhere, has written them better. But if I don’t start now, I know I’ll wake up in five years mad at myself for never trying.

Maybe by then I’ll have ideas that I’m confident are original. And who knows, maybe I already do.`,
